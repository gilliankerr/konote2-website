        <h2>Licensing & Cost</h2>

        <div class="faq-item is-open">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="true">
            Is KoNote really free?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes. KoNote is released under the MIT Licence, which means you can use,
              modify, and distribute it freely — including for commercial purposes.
              There are no licence fees, no per-user pricing, no premium tiers.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will have hosting costs (the servers that run KoNote), but those
              go to your hosting provider, not to us. Typical hosting costs range
              from $45–150 CAD/month depending on your platform choice.
            </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            What's the catch?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No catch, but there are trade-offs:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>You're responsible for deployment, security, and maintenance</li>
              <li>There's no vendor support — just community help via GitHub</li>
              <li>You need technical capacity (or a partner who has it)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you want a fully managed solution where someone else handles everything,
              KoNote isn't that. If you're comfortable with self-hosting and want
              full control over your data, KoNote is a good fit.

          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Can we modify KoNote for our needs?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes. The MIT Licence explicitly allows modification. You can change
              the code, add features, or adapt it however you need. You can even
              redistribute your modified version.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you make improvements that would benefit others, we'd welcome
              contributions back to the main project — but that's optional.

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              <strong>Community support:</strong> You can ask questions and report issues
              on <a href="https://github.com/LogicalOutcomes/konote/issues">GitHub</a>.
              There are no guaranteed response times — it depends on who's available
              and whether someone knows the answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Professional support:</strong> If you need guaranteed help,

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            How do updates work?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              New versions are released on GitHub. You're responsible for monitoring
              releases and applying updates to your deployment. The deployment guide
              includes instructions for updating.
            </p>
            <p>
              Updates are not automatic — you control when to update. This means
              you can test updates before applying them, but it also means you
              need to actively keep your installation current.

            What if the project is abandoned?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The MIT Licence means the code is yours forever. If active development
              stops, you can:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Continue using your current version indefinitely</li>
              <li>Fork the project and maintain it yourself</li>
              <li>Find someone else to maintain a fork</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You're not locked into a vendor relationship that could disappear.

        <h2 class="mt-8">Technical Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            How many participants can KoNote handle?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              KoNote has been tested with up to approximately 2,000 active participants.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main limitation is encrypted search: because PII is encrypted,
              participant search loads accessible participants into memory and filters in Python.
              This works well at smaller scales but may slow down with larger participant bases.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have significantly more participants, we recommend performance testing
              before committing to KoNote.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Can we migrate data from another system?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              There are no built-in migration tools. Data migration requires:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Exporting data from your current system</li>
              <li>Mapping fields to KoNote's data model</li>
              <li>Writing a script to import the data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This is technically possible but requires development work specific
              to your source system. If you need help with this, mention it when
              contacting us about <a href="services.html">professional services</a>.

            Does KoNote work offline?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No. KoNote is a web application that requires an internet connection
              to access. There's no offline mode or mobile app with local storage.
            </p>
            <p>
              If staff need to work in locations without internet, they would need
              to take notes elsewhere and enter them into KoNote later.

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              KoNote doesn't have a public API, so direct integration isn't straightforward.
            </p>
            <p>
              Options include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>CSV export/import for batch data transfer</li>
              <li>Custom development to add API endpoints (Django makes this possible)</li>
              <li>Direct database access (with caution and understanding of the schema)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-8">Organisational Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Why isn't KoNote offered as a SaaS?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Participant data is sensitive. Many nonprofits need full control over where
              that data lives — for regulatory compliance, funder requirements, or
              organisational policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              A self-hosted model means:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>You choose where data is stored (Canadian servers if needed)</li>
              <li>You're not dependent on a vendor's business continuity</li>
              <li>You can inspect exactly what the software does</li>
              <li>No risk of a vendor raising prices or changing terms</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Is KoNote suitable for clinical settings?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              KoNote is designed for outcome tracking in social services, not clinical
              documentation. It lacks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Standardised clinical assessment tools</li>
              <li>Treatment planning features</li>
              <li>Prescription or medication tracking</li>
              <li>Healthcare-specific compliance features (HIPAA, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you need a clinical EMR/EHR, KoNote isn't the right tool.
              If you need to track participant outcomes alongside clinical work,
              KoNote could complement (not replace) your clinical system.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              KoNote is designed for single-agency use. While you could technically
              create separate "programs" for different organisations, there's no
              true multi-tenancy with data isolation between organisations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each organisation should run their own instance for proper data
              separation and security.

            <p>
              KoNote has full English and French bilingual support, following canada.ca
              conventions. Users can switch languages with a single click, and all
              terminology, labels, and system text appear in the selected language.
            </p>
            <p>
              Agencies can customise all terminology in both languages to match their
              preferred wording. Full internationalisation to other languages beyond
              English and French would require development work.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              KoNote includes optional AI-assisted features that help staff with
              documentation tasks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Suggesting metrics based on outcome target descriptions</li>
              <li>Improving goal statement wording</li>

            <p>
              AI features are privacy-safe — no participant identifying information is ever
              sent to the AI service. The feature can be disabled entirely via a toggle
              if your organisation prefers not to use it.
