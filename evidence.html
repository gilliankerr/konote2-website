        <p class="hero-tagline">
          KoNote2 is designed around research on what helps participants succeed —
          not just what's convenient for agencies or funders.

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Most outcome tracking software is designed backward. It starts with funder
          reporting requirements and works down to data collection. Participants become
          data sources rather than partners in their own progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          KoNote2 takes a different approach. We started with research on what actually
          improves participant outcomes, then designed software to support those practices.
          The reporting features exist, but they're not the foundation.

        <h2>The Research</h2>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Feedback-Informed Treatment</h3>
            <p>
              Research by Scott Miller, Barry Duncan, and colleagues has consistently
              shown that routinely collecting client feedback and using it to guide
              services leads to significantly better outcomes. Clients are more likely
              to achieve meaningful change, and at-risk cases show the greatest improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key finding: the act of systematically asking clients about their
              experience strengthens the working relationship — and that relationship
              is the strongest predictor of outcomes across service types.
            </p>

          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Collaborative Documentation</h3>
            <p>
              Studies on collaborative documentation — where clients participate in
              creating their own records — show that most clients find it helpful
              and that it improves treatment adherence. When clients see and contribute
              to what's being written about them, trust increases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Transparency isn't just ethical; it's clinically effective. Clients
              sense alliance ruptures before service providers do. Routine feedback
              catches problems early, before clients disengage.

            <h3>Brevity and Simplicity</h3>
            <p>
              Implementation research consistently shows that brief tools see better
              compliance than lengthy ones. Even single-item measures can be
              psychometrically valid when designed well. The Outcome Rating Scale
              and Session Rating Scale work because each takes under a minute.
            </p>
            <p>
              When feedback tools feel like administrative burden rather than clinical
              support, compliance becomes "empty" — going through the motions without
              genuine engagement.

        <h2>What We're Not Claiming</h2>

        <div class="notice notice-info">
          <p class="notice-title">Important distinction</p>
          <p>
            The research cited above studied clinical practices — not this software.
            KoNote2 is designed to <em>support</em> feedback-informed practice, but
            we haven't conducted randomised trials of KoNote2 itself.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          To be clear about what we're saying:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>We are saying:</strong> Research shows that feedback-informed
            practice and collaborative documentation improve client outcomes.
            KoNote2 is designed to make those practices easier to implement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>We are not saying:</strong> Using KoNote2 will automatically
            improve your outcomes. That depends on how you use it, how you implement it,
            and whether it fits your context.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          KoNote2 is new software. We'd welcome partnerships with researchers interested
          in evaluating its effectiveness in real-world settings.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Implementation Matters</h2>

        <p>
          The research is also clear about what goes wrong. Feedback tools fail when:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Staff perceive them as surveillance rather than support</li>
          <li>The feedback goes into a database but doesn't inform the next session</li>
          <li>Filling in forms disrupts the human moment in a conversation</li>
          <li>Tools are too long or complex for routine use</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          KoNote2 can't solve these problems by itself. Software is a tool, not a solution.
          Whether feedback-informed practice works at your agency depends on:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Leadership commitment to using feedback, not just collecting it</li>
          <li>Staff training on how to invite honest feedback from participants</li>
          <li>A culture where participant input genuinely shapes service delivery</li>
          <li>Realistic expectations about what data can and can't tell you</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you're looking for software that will magically improve your outcomes
          without changing anything else, KoNote2 isn't that. If you're looking for
          a tool that supports the practices research shows actually work, we've
          tried to build that.
